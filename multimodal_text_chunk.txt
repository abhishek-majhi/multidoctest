Multimodal architectures:

Multimodal learning refers to the process of learning representations from
different types of input modalities, such as image data, text or speech. Due to
methodological breakthroughs in the fields of Natural Language Processing
(NLP) as well as Computer Vision (CV) in recent years, multimodal models
have gained increasing attention as they are able to strengthen predictions
and better emulate the way humans learn. This chapter focuses on discussing
images and text as input data.
